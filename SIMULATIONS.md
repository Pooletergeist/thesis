***What is sufficient for ecology? 
- Competition for resources? 
- Differential reproduction?
- ability to cooperate?***

## Reproductions:
- 2016 Cancer Stem Cells in dynamically growing domain
- 2005 Mixed model: resources := differential equations. CA moves towards.
- 2007 3 moddels:


## New Work:
### V1. Without spatial resource distribution across the grid. (except space)
*expect: power law observable, what else?*
- Energetics -> (life history strategy emergence)
    OPTIONS:
a. Make it more costly to create offspring with easier survival. -> hardcoded LH
b. Allow everything mutable. -> low cost high reproduction
c. Constant cost of reproduction, variable probabilities. -> biology alters its levers, but physics imposes cost of life.
    RESOURCE OPTIONS:
1. cells get fixed allowance each timestep
2. cells get energy probabalistically (big bundles infrequently or small often)
3. V2 spatial allocation.

- Genetics -> (dartboard & power-law recreations)

- Ecological??

### V2. With resource distribution across the grid.
*expect: dartboard & life hsistory observable*
